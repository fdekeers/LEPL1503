    A hacker wanted to challenge you and encrypted your hard drive. To unlock your drive, he gave you a function ``get_key(int a, char b, int c)`` which returns the decryption key if the correct parameters are given.

    He then hid the parameters *a*, *b* and *c* in memory, and gave you a pointer from which you can retrieve these parameters.

            You found a hint from the hacker, telling the first parameter is  located at the 12th byte after *ptr*. An int is guaranteed to be 4 bytes long.

            Write the body of the function *first* which returns the integer at that position in memory.

            .. code-block:: c

                int first(void *ptr) {
        type: code
        language: c
        default: ''
        name: First argument
    second:
        default: ''
        language: c
        type: code
        header: |-
            The second parameter is a char located 6 bytes after *ptr*.

            Write the body of the function *second* which returns the char at that position in memory.

            .. code-block:: c

                char second(void *ptr) {
        name: Second argument
    third:
        name: Third argument
        header: |-
            The third parameter is an int located 45 bytes after *ptr*.

            Write the body of the function *third* which returns the int at that position in memory.

            .. code-block:: c

                int third(void *ptr) {
        type: code
